1- Place the "PereiraSystem" folder into AoE Definitive Edition "resources/common/ai" folder

2 - Move "PereiraLoader.ai" and "PereiraLoader.per" files from the "PereiraSystem" folder to the upper level (AoE Definitive Edition "resources/common/ai")
where you put the main folder first

3- Once inside the game pick the player "PereiraLoader"

4- Ready for battle!


Best settings:

- Population 150, 175, 200, 225

- Maps like Amazon Tunnel and Black Forest where the attack can be more focused.

Pereira System AI will try to build some cute walls in the lowest difficulty settings sometimes, 
making it less competitive.
